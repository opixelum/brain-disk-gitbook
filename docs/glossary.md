## A

### Abstraction

Key concept of object-oriented programming, that refers to handle complexity
by hiding unnecessary details from the user.

### Application Programming Interface (API)

Mechanism that enables an application or service to access a resource within
another application or service.

### Application software

Program designed to do a specific task other than an operation for the computer
itself, like user-oriented tasks. Example: text editor, media player, ...

## B

### Backdoor

Typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a
computer, product, embedded device, or its embodiment.

### Basic Input Output System (BIOS)

[Firmware](#firmware) used to provide runtime services for
[OS](#operating-system-os) & programs & to perform hardware initialization
during the booting process.

### Big Data

Field that treats ways to extract, store, analyse & process for creating value
for an organization, meeting the 5 V's: volume, velocity, variety, veracity &
value.

### Bitmask

Pattern of bits indicating which bits in a second pattern are to be modified.
E.g.: a binary IP address mask is a bitmask.

### Blockchain

List of data organized by immutable blocks, managed by a peer-to-peer network,
as a distributed ledger.

## C

### Certificate Authority (CA)

Entity that stores, signs & issues
[digital certificates](#digital-certificate).

### Consensus

General agreement. In decentralized systems, it brings nodes back in sync. To
reach consensus, mechanisms such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake and more are
used.

## D

### Data Lake

Centralized repository of raw data collected from various sources for further
processing.

### Data Warehouse

Centralized repository of data collected from various sources within an
organization, designed to support business decisions.

### Decentralization

Process of distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things
away from a central location or authority.

### Delegate call (Solidity)

Type of function call in Solidity that allows to execute code of another
contract while preserving the current context (storage, caller, value, ...).
Often used to implement proxy contracts.

### Digital certificate

Electronic document used to prove the validity of a [public key](#public-key).

### Double-spending

Potential flaw in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token
can be spent more than once. It can lead to inflation by creating a new amount
of copied currency that did not previously exist.

## E

### Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP)

Standards specifying potential new features or processes for Ethereum.

### Encapsulation

Key concept of object-oriented programming, that refers to bundle data &
methods into a single unit, frequently in the form of class.

## F

### Firmware

Computer software that provides the low-level control for a device's specific
hardware.

## I

### Inflation

General increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy. It is
caused by a decrease in the purchasing power of money. This decrease can be
caused by an increase in the amount of money in circulation (printing money).

### Inheritance

Key concept of object-oriented programming, that refers to derive a class from
other classes.

### Interrupt

Request for the processor to interrupt currently executing code, by saving its
state, then to execute an
[interrupt handler](#interrupt-service-routine-isr-or-interrupt-handler)
(or
[Interrupt Service Routine](#interrupt-service-routine-isr-or-interrupt-handler)
, or [ISR](#interrupt-service-routine-isr-or-interrupt-handler)), in order to
execute another process.

### Interrupt Service Routine (ISR or interrupt handler)

Special block of code used for implementing device drivers or transitions
between protected modes of operation, such as system calls.

## K

### Kernel

Program at core of a computer's OS which has complete control over the system,
for managing interactions between hardware and software components.

## L

### Liquidity

Refers to how easy it is to trade assets without impacting their price.

### Liquidity pool

Pile of cryptocurrencies locked in a smart contract.

### Liquidity provider

Person who fund a liquidity pool with assets.

## N

### Nonce

- _[general]_

    Number used only once.

- _[blockchain]_

    32-bits number that miners need to find, for finding the next block hash
    and getting rewarded.

## O

### Object-oriented programming

Paradigm in which programs are structured around objects or data fields rather
than functions or logic.

### Operating system (OS)

System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and
provides common services for computer programs.

### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources to produce
actionable intelligence.

### Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

Online community that produces freely-available articles, methodologies,
documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security.

## P

### Penetration test (pentest)

Authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate
the security of the system.

### Polymorphism

Describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through
the same interface.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Key step in the development of a new product or service, where we demonstrate
its sustainability.

### Public key

Cryptographic element that is the publicity shared half of an encryption code &
that can be used only to encode messages.

## R

### Register

Quickly accessible memory location in a CPU that stores data for arithmetic
operations.

### Representational State Transfer (REST)

Architectural style for developing web services.

### REST API

API that conforms to the design principles of the REST architectural style.

## S

### Slippage

Refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at
which the trade is executed.

### Swap

Refers to exchanging one crypto asset to another.

### System software

Program that manages memory, files, processor, ... It also provides interfaces
between [application software](#application-software) and hardware.

## U

### Upkeep (Chainlink)

Smart contract registered on the Keepers Registry, so the Keepers Network can
automate it.

### Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

Unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource
used by web technologies.
