# Fitting

- Minibatch (or just "batch"): group of training data sample for an
  iteration (before measuring the loss & optimize);
- Epoch: an iteration through the whole training dataset. The number of epochs
  is how many times the network will see each training example;
- Gradient: vector telling in which direction the weights need to go for
  minimizing the loss.
