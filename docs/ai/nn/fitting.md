# Fitting

- Minibatch (or just "batch"): a single training data simple of an iteration;
- Epoch: an iteration through the whole training dataset. The number of epochs
  is how many times the network will see each training example;
- Gradient: vector telling in which direction the weights need to go for
  minimizing the loss.
