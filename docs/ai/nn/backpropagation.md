# Backpropagation

## Definition

- Learning algorithm for neural networks;
- Updates the weights for better predictions.

## Loss Function

- Measures the difference between the predicted and the actual output;
- A high value means the model is not performing well.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### Cross Entropy

## Optimization Algorithms

- Minimize the loss function by updating the weights of the network.

### Gradient Descent

### RMSProp

### Adam
