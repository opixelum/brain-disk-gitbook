# Machine Learning

## Introduction

- Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where algorithms learn from and make predictions on data.
- Model: In ML, a model is a representation of an algorithm's learned patterns from data. It's what you use to make predictions on new data.
- Deep Learning: A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers. It's more complex and requires more data.
- Neural Networks in ML: Traditional machine learning can utilize simpler neural networks, but not all ML algorithms are based on them.
- Codeability: Machine learning is "codeable", involving algorithms that learn from data. Libraries simplify this process.

## Steps to Create a Machine Learning Algorithm

1. Data Collection: Gather data relevant to your problem.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform data to a usable format.
3. Feature Engineering: Select or create the most relevant input features.
4. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate algorithm based on the problem.
5. Training: Feed the training data to the model to learn patterns.
6. Evaluation: Test the model's performance on the validation set.
7. Tuning: Adjust parameters to optimize performance.
8. Deployment: Implement the model in a real-world application.

## Common Algorithms & Their Uses

- Linear Regression: Predict continuous values.
- Logistic Regression: Classify data into two categories.
- Decision Trees: Make decisions based on questions.
- Random Forest: Uses multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- K-Means Clustering: Group data into 'k' clusters.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Classify data by finding the best boundary.
- Simple Neural Networks: Used in some ML tasks; less deep than deep learning networks.

## Ensemble Methods

Using Multiple Algorithms: Yes, you can combine multiple algorithms to improve predictive performance. This is known as ensemble learning.

- Bagging: Uses multiple instances of the same algorithm on different subsets of data.
- Boosting: Sequentially applies algorithms, where each one corrects the errors of its predecessor.
- Stacking: Combines predictions from multiple algorithms to make a final prediction.

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy: How often the model is correct.
- Precision & Recall: Balance between correctly predicted positives and actual positives.
- F1 Score: Combines precision and recall.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average error in regression tasks.

## Overfitting & Underfitting

- Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Balance between simplicity (bias) and complexity (variance).
- Regularization: Add penalty to complex models to prevent overfitting.

Tools & Libraries

- Languages: Python and R are popular for ML.
- Scikit-learn: Comprehensive Python library for ML.
- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation.
- NumPy: Python library for numerical operations.

Tips

- Always visualize your data.
- Start simple and then explore complexity.
- Update your model with new data when possible.
