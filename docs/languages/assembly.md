# Assembly

## Introduction

Assembly is the lowest level of language (just above binary).

It is platform specific (different for each CPU architecture: x86, x86-64, ARM,
...).

It was used to write code close to the hardware, but is now mostly used for
reverse engineering (understanding how malwares work).

It is one of fastest language, with C, but also the most difficult to write &
maintain. Today, some C compilers can compile C code directly to binary,
without using assembly. That's why assembly is less used than before.

## Types

| Type | Declaration | Size |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| **Byte** | `db` | 1 byte |
| **Word** | `dw` |Â 2 bytes |
| **Double word** | `dd` | 4 bytes |
| **Quadruple word** | `dq` | 8 bytes |
| **Ten bytes** | `dt` | 10 bytes |

*Example:*

```asm
choice      DB    'y'
number      DW    65535
negative    DD    -2147483648
big         DQ    9223372036854775807
very_big    DT    18446744073709551615
```

**Note:**

- **Characters** are stored as its **ASCII** value in **hexadecimal**;
- There is no **signed & unsigned types differentiation**;
- **Negative values** are **automatically** converted to its **2's complement
representation**;
- There is **no floating point & integer types differentiation**;
- **float** & **double** are represented using **32 bits** & **64 bits**
respectively.

## Format

| Format | Data type |
| ------ | --------- |
| `%d` | DWORD |
| `%hd` | WORD |
| `%hhd` | BYTE |

## Input

- `rdi` is used to store the **format** of the input (e.g. `%d`).
- `rsi` is used to store the **address** of the variable where the input will
be stored.
- `rax` is equal to `1` if we scan a **float**, `0` otherwise.

```asm
extern scanf

global main

section .data
    fmt_scan: db '%hd', 0 ; 0 is the null terminator (end of string)

section .bss
    user_input: resb 2 ; resb = reserve bytes for uninitialized data

section .text
main:
    mov rdi, fmt_scan 
    mov rsi, user_input
    mov rax, 0
    call scanf
```

## Output

- `rdi` is used to store the **format** of the output (e.g. `%d`).
- `rsi` is used to store the **value** to be printed.
- `rax` is equal to `1` if we print a **float**, `0` otherwise.

```asm
extern printf

global main

section .data
    fmt_print db 'The number is %hhd', 10, 0 ; 10 is the newline character
    number db 10

main:
    mov rdi, fmt_print
    mov rsi, number
    mov rax, 0
    call printf
```

## Conditions

`cmp` is used to **compare two values**. It subtracts the second value from the
first one and sets the flags `ZF`, `SF`, `CF` & `OF`. Then we can use `j`
instructions to **jump** to a label if a condition is **true**.

| Condition | Instruction | Sign |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| **Equal** | `je` | signed or unsigned |
| **Not equal** | `jne` | signed or unsigned |
| **Above** | `ja` | unsigned |
| **Above or equal** | `jae` | unsigned |
| **Below** | `jb` | unsigned |
| **Below or equal** | `jbe` | unsigned |
| **Greater** | `jg` | signed |
| **Greater or equal** | `jge` | signed |
| **Lower** | `jl` | signed |
| **Lower or equal** | `jle` | signed |

```asm
greater:
    mov     eax, 1

main:
    cmp     eax, ebx
    jg      greater
```

## Compilation

First, we need to **assemble** the assembly code to get the **object file**:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o file.o file.asm
```

- `-f elf64` is used to specify the **format** of the object file. `elf64` is
used for **x86-64**.

- `-o file.o` is used to specify the **object file**.

- The last argument is the **assembly code file**.

Then, we need to **link** the object file to get the **executable**:

```bash
gcc -m64 -no-pie -o file file.o
```

- `-m64` is used to specify the **architecture** of the executable. `64` is
used for **x86-64**.

- `-no-pie` is used to specify that we don't want a **position independent
executable**.

- `-o file` is used to specify the **executable name** we will create.

- The last argument is the **object file**.

## Notes

- If `[rax]` is used but no valid memory address is stored in `rax`, there is a
segmentation fault.

- `[rax + 5]` means that we take the value stored 5 bytes after the address
stored in `rax`. If `rax` is `0x1000`, then `[rax + 5]` is the value stored at
`0x1005`. Same for `-`.
