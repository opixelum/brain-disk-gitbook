# Java

## Description

- General-purpose programming language;
- Object-oriented;
- Runs on a virtual machine (JVM), so it's cross-platform;
- Compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM.

## History

- Created by Sun Microsystems in 1995;
- Open source since 2006;
- Acquired by Oracle in 2010.

## Principles

1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar;
2. It must be robust and secure;
3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable;
4. It must execute with high performance;
5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

## Usage

- Android apps;
- Desktop apps;
- Client-server web apps.

## Inheritance

- Inherit from a class using the `extends` keyword;
- `final` classes cannot be extended;
- Every class in Java inherits from `Object`;
- Multiple inheritance is not supported.
- 
### Constructors in inheritance

- If parent hasn't any constructor, child can define its own or not;
- If no constructor is defined in both, the default constructor of each class is
  called;
- If parent has one or more constructors, child must define at least one
  constructor, and it must call one of the parent's constructors using the
  `super` keyword.
