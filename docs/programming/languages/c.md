## Pointers

### Definition

A pointer is a variable that stores a memory location (or an address of a
variable).

### Declaration syntax
```c
datatype *var_name;

// E.g.:
int *ptr;
```

### Operators

#### * (asterisk)

The unary operator **\* (asterisk)** is used for two things:
- To declare a pointer variable (see example above);
- To access the value stored in a pointer. This is called **"deferencing"**.

#### & (ampersand)

To get the address of a variable, we use the unary operator **& (ampersand)**.
For example, **&x** gives us the **address of variable x**.
