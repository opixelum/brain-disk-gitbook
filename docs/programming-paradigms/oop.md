# Object-Oriented Programming

## Classes

- Blueprints for creating objects.

## Objects

- Instances of a class.

## Interfaces

- A class can implement multiple interfaces;
- Interfaces contain only abstract methods (methods without implementation);
- Interfaces cannot contain attributes.

## Inheritance

- A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- The parent class is extended, and child class extends the parent.
- Private attributes and methods are not inherited.

## Composition

- A class can contain objects of other classes as attributes.
- We can "inject" dependencies by requiring an argument as an instance of
another class.

## Encapsulation

- Set visibility to attributes & methods.

## Abstraction

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
- Abstract classes must be extended.
- Allow to declare methods without implementation. These methods must be
implemented in the child class.

## Polymorphism

- Change the behaviour of an extended class by overriding methods.
