# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Definition

A convolutional neural network is a type of feed-forward neural network that
learns to extract attributes by itself from grid-like data (images, 2D data,
etc.) via filters (kernels).

## Structure

A convolutional neural network is composed of the following layers:

### Convolutional Layers

- Most of the computation is done here;
- Extracts attributes from the input data;
- The Number of neurons is equal to the number of filters (kernels);
- Each neuron has a different kernel;
- Each neuron processes a part of the input data (receptive field) at the time.
  When it is done with a receptive field, it moves to the next one;
- After a neuron has processed the whole input data, it results in a feature
  map.

### Pooling Layers

### Fully Connected Layers

### Convolutional Layer
