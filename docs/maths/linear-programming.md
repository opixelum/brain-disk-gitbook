# Linear Programming

## Simplex Algorithm

### Table Method

- Faster than the equation method (less verbose);
- Less semantically clear than the equation method;
- `Z` column must only contain `0`'s or `1`'s;
- The algorithm stops when the `Z` row contains only positive values.

### Equation Method

- Slower than the graphical method (more verbose);
- More semantically clear than the table method;
