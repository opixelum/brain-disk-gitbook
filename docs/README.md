# Brain Disk

## **The most powerful data storage device is in your head.**

Brain disk is a place where you can find **cheat sheets** about anything I've
learned in **IT**. It's a place where I store my knowledge in **computer**
**science** and share it with the world, but also a place where **YOU** can
provide your knowledge to the world.

You can find cheat sheets about:

- [Blockchain](blockchain/README.md)
- [Data Science](data-science/README.md)
- [Documentation](documentation/README.md)
- [Systems](systems/README.md)
- [Languages](languages/README.md)
- [Cybersecurity](cybersecurity/README.md)
- and more in the future...

Please note that this project is **fairly new** and is **still in**
**development**. That's why you can find some empty pages for the moment (that
means that I'm planning to add content to those pages). If you find any errors
or have any suggestions, please create an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/opixelum/brain-disk/issues/new).
