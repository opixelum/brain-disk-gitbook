# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

## What

System that creates a direct link between remote computers, isolating their
exchanges from the rest of the traffic taking place on public networks.

## Why

- **Security**: VPNs encrypt data to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
- **Privacy**: VPNs hide the IP address of the user, making it difficult to
track the user's online activity.
- **Geo-spoofing**: VPNs can make it appear as if the user is located in a
different country, allowing to bypass geo-restrictions.

## How

- **Tunneling**: VPNs use tunneling protocols (IPSec, OpenVPN, etc.) to create
a secure connection between two devices.
- **Encryption**: VPNs use encryption protocols (AES, RSA, etc.) to encrypt
data and make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
- **VPN server**: computer that routes traffic, assigns IP addresses
to users & encrypts/decrypts data from clients.
- **VPN client**: software that connects to VPN servers & encrypts/decrypts
data for the user.

**Encryption algorithms, protocols & settings must match on both the client**
**and the server.**
