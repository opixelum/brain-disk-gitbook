# Operating systems

## Introduction

An operating system is a system software that manages computer hardware,
software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Without an OS, only one software would run and would be in charge of
everthing on the computer, including the hardware.

## System & application softwares

**System softwares** are in charge of:

- managing **memory**;
- managing **programs execution**;
- allowing several programs to **exchange data between them**;
- managing all **computer's peripherals**;
- managing **files**, **network**, **sound** & **display**.

Then, **application** software let the **user** do **tasks** that may involve
calls to some system softwares.

But depending on the hardware, an OS can't manage all devices or peripherals.
That's why the computer needs **drivers**, which is a system software, often
provided by the manufacturer of the device.
