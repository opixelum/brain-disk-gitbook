# Consensus mechanisms

## Definition of consensus

A consensus is a general agreement. In decentralized systems, it brings nodes
back in sync (every nodes agrees on the same state).

## Definition of consensus mechanism

A consensus mechanism is a stack of protocols, incentives & ideas that allows
nodes to reach consensus.

In general, consensus mechanisms encourage individuals to operate honestly by
rewarding them. It can also punish malicious nodes (such as in PoS).

## Types of consensus mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW)

It involves miners who solve complicated mathematical puzzles to produce a new
block. The more a node has computing power, the more chance it has to solve the
puzzle and produce a new block. The first node to solve the puzzle gets
rewarded with an amount of a cryptocurrency.

It is used by Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, ...

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

It uses a randomized process to figure out who gets a chance to produce the
next block. Stake (amount of cryptocurrency locked) is needed to participate in
the consensus process. If a node acts honestly, it will get rewarded in
cryptocurrency. If not, it will lose a part of its stake.

Used by Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, Cosmos, Algorand, NEAR,
Elrond, ...

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

Users can stake their cryptocurrency & vote for a node to produce the next
block.

Used by Solana, Tron, EOS, Tezos, ...

### Proof of Capacity (PoC)

Stores solution of complex mathematical puzzles in digital storage devices
such as hard disks that are used to create new blocks.

Used by Storj, Burst, Chia & SpaceMint.

### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)

Randomly & fairly decides the producer of a new block based on their waiting
time.

Used by Hyperledger Sawtooth.
