# Scaling

## Sharding

- Split network into smaller partitions called shards;
- Nodes are assigned to a shard;
- Nodes don't need to store the entire blockchain anymore;
- Transactions are executed in parallel;
- Increases the number of transactions per second;
- Similar to a highway road with more lanes: more cars can ride simultaneously;
- Layer 1 scaling solution;
- Can help reduce gas fees since network is less congested.
