# Combinatorics & Complexity

## Introduction

## Related domains

- **Operational research**: methods & techniques to solve problems for
**optimization**;
- **AI** (M. Minsky): software for solving problems that are easy for humans
but hard for computers (for now), like **learning**, **thinking**, ...

## 2 AI approaches

- **Weak AI**: AI is just a tool, like a calculator;
- **Strong AI**: software can re-write itself to solve any problem (AGI).

### Turing test

A human interacts with a computer and a human, and has to guess which one is the
computer (if he can't, the computer is intelligent).

Eg: when chatting with someone one WhatsApp, is it a human or a bot?
